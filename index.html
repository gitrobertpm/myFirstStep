			<h3>LOGICAL CONCLUSIONS</h3>
			<p class="section">Life, the world, and everything else in the cosmos actually exist as a part of reality in at least some way.  Some things exist in a very real way, while other things only exist in a fictional, imaginary, or otherwise abstract sort of way, but they all exist somehow.<br><br>The trouble is that sometimes it's difficult to tell the difference between the two with only five limited senses through which reality may be observed.  For instance, the Earth is real, but what about its nations and the ever-changing borders by which they are separated?<br><br>The laws of physics are real, even though humanity's grasp of such laws remains largely skewed, flawed, or incomplete.  But what about the laws of the many human-made organizations, say for instance, the made up institutions and procedures of the lofty and self-important American Judicial system?   Or a professional sports franchise?  Or what about an entire nation?  Are the laws of the United Sates Federal Government any more real than the laws that govern the boy scouts, or the employees of a Chuck E. Cheese's, or a game of friggin' Monopoly?<br><br>The consequences of breaking these fabricated figment-like rules may vary greatly in their severity, but the extent of their individual bonafide authenticity remains identical as they only exist in the mind, and for only as long as there exists a mind to breath life into these imaginations through the dangerous magic of belief.</p>

			<p class="section">Everything, including the Earth, the sun, the moon, and especially any living thing, all have eventual expiration dates, and each will one day cease to exist, at least in their present forms.<br><br>Nothing yet observed in the cosmos suggests the possibility of anything lasting forever.  Every bit of rational evidence shows that all things are impermanent, but also that nothing ever really ends.  Things merely reach the end of a particular journey and then through natural processes, change into some new thing.  We call it death, but in truth, and tragically, it's something about which even our wisest scientists and philosophers and religious leaders really know very little.</p>

			<p class="section">The qualities of reality seem ultimately unknowable by its inhabitants.  Whatever secrets reality may hold about its possible origin, purpose, and fate seem beyond the reach of those trapped within the confines of this reality, like little figurines trapped within a snow globe, and unable to know the snow globe's true nature.<br><br>If one looks, one can see the freedom in not knowing the purpose of it all.  Not knowing creates a vacancy that can be filled by anything whatsoever.<br><br>But for the restless truth seeker, no comfort can be found in those thoughts or the bogus freedom they provide.  After all, an item of one's own choosing placed at the altar of all things, no matter how importantly perceived as it may be, would still be no better than a guess, which not only seems sort of phony, but such a thing would likely stand in the way of discovering the truth.<br><br>And what could be more important than knowing the truth?</p>
